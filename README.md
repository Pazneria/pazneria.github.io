# pazneria.github.io

This repository contains the static files for the **Pazneria** website. It hosts the marketing pages and other standalone experiments as pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The playable OSRS-inspired prototype lives in its own repository, [`game`](https://github.com/pazneria/game). The navigation on this site simply links to the published build at <https://pazneria.github.io/game/>, keeping the codebases independent.

To preview the site locally, open the HTML files in a browser or use any static web server to serve the repository root.
