# pazneria.github.io

This repository contains the static files for the **Pazneria** website. It is a simple static site composed of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The site hosts various small projects and experiments. Notably, under `game/` lives a canvas-based RPG written in JavaScript. Open the `game/` directory (e.g. visit `/game/` in the browser) to launch the prototype.

Previous experiments, such as the early *Dataforge* idle game, have since been removed to keep the repository focused on the current content.
