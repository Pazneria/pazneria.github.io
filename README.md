# pazneria.github.io

This repository contains the static files for the **Pazneria** website. It is a simple static site composed of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The site hosts various small projects and experiments. Notably, under `game/` lives a canvas-based RPG written in JavaScript. You can open `game.html` to play the game directly in your browser.

Previous experiments, such as the early *Dataforge* idle game, have since been removed to keep the repository focused on the current content.
