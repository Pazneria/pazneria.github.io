# pazneria.github.io

This repository contains the static files for the **Pazneria** website. It is a simple static site composed of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The site hosts various small projects and experiments. Notably, under `game/` lives a canvas-based RPG written in JavaScript. You can open `game.html` to play the game directly in your browser.

Older code for the Dataforge idle game has been removed. References remain in some of the page navigation, but the legacy implementation has been cleaned out of the repository.
